         <h2>Introduction</h2>
         <p>Rae's Rentals</p>
         <p>Rae's Rentals is a surf shop in Lahaina, Hawaii, located right on the beach. Our shop rents boards ranging from 5–10 feet in length. Rent a board for as long as you need starting at $20/day, or try one of our guided lessons in Lahaina Reef. In addition, we also provide reef shoes and rash guards free of charge. While you’re in our shop, check out our reef friendly sunscreen, apparel, and grab a fresh fruit smoothie!</p>
         <h2>Target audience</h2>
         <p>While Rae’s Rentals has something for everyone, their target market is tourists looking for a beginner surfing experience. Our rental shop is family oriented, and our business model is targeted at groups of friends or families on vacation looking to enjoy an experience together. Our trained instructors and proximity to the Lahaina Reef ensures beginners will be successful in catching their first wave. </p>
         <p>Our website is beneficial for those planning their trip in advance. It allows users to reserve boards for certain days, book lessons in advance, and pay ahead of time. Since Rae’s Rentals is a small business with a single location, our website allows users to visit our shop without physically being on the island.</p>
