			<div class="eight columns portfolio"><h2>Brass Ring Social Media</h2><p>Since November of 2019, I have been working for Brass Ring Social Media, a marketing company that manages ads and social media sites for local companies. My responsibilities vary from content creation to consumer engagement. I utilize Facebook Business Manager to oversee ten unique accounts and reply to various direct messages and comments. I also create relevant, aesthetically pleasing monthly post plans in Adobe Photoshop to increase engagement with followers.</p></div>

			<div class="eight columns portfolio"><h2>Digital and New Media Marketing</h2><p>I took a business course titled “Digital and New Media Marketing.” Coursework included learning specifics about social media sites (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, Pinterest, YouTube, TikTok, and LinkedIn), how to effectively manage accounts, and how to create content that accurately represented the organization's image and maintained their reputation. We also worked through Hootsuite’s social media course, learning how to effectively create and place advertisements on a variety of platforms. In addition, our class competed in a social media marketing competition created by Mimic Pro, in which I placed in the top five of my classmates. Finally, I learned how to conduct a social media audit, and evaluated existing social media pages, competitors, key performance indicators, and demographics. I then took this information and proposed a plan to adjust marketing strategies in order to increase engagement and productivity. </p></div>

			<div class="eight columns portfolio"><h2>Listening to the Consumer</h2><p>Throughout the course “Listening to the Consumer,” I learned the importance of the research process. I learned how to effectively use different research methods to analyze, interpret, and present results. I worked in a group to review a social media marketing strategy for a non-profit organization. Together, we identified our demographic and developed personas, conducted a SWOT analysis, and moderated focus groups. Then, individually conducted one-on-one interviews and surveys to get an in-depth understanding of how consumers perceive nonprofits. Finally, we presented our findings concisely to the nonprofit in order to aid them in modifying their marketing strategies.</p></div>

				<h2 class="bio">About Me</h2>
					<p class="bio">Hi, my name is Kelsey Deuth and I am a student at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Graphic Communication, concentrating in User Experience and User Interface, and minoring in Integrated Marketing Communications. I have extensive experience with Adobe Creative Cloud, including Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign, and Dreamweaver. I am also skilled in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. My design and marketing skills aided me in coding this website to serve as a working portfolio for my projects. In my free time I love exploring outside, playing with my dog, going to the beach, and baking. Thank you for taking the time to view my work!</p>
